# In this section you can determine how much XP are players going to receive on different in-game events.
# You can use any weapon name to determine how much XP a player is going to receive when killing another player with that weapon.
# In addition, you can use a bunch of different defined keywords such as "headshot" or "bomb_planted".
# For a full list of keywords, read parts 2 and 3 in the link in the beginning of the file.

# Please note that if USE_COMBINED_EVENTS is set to 1, some of the events will be combined.
# For example: if you kill someone with a headshot with the USP, you will get the XP for "kill", "headshot", and "usp".
# If set to 0, you will get the XP for the event with the highest priority which in the example above is "usp".

# You can set a different amount of XP for users who have the flags set in VIP_FLAGS by separating it with a space.
